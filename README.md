# ecchi-otg-2000
This plugin enables OTG on your PS Vita 2000, so you can connect DS3, DS4, some generic controllers (you may need to install the [MiniVitaTV plugin](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/MiniVitaTV) to make controllers work), storage devices and more to your Vita. </br> Please be aware that you need **a Y OTG cable** if you want to connect to 2000 (since you need external power source). Regular OTG cables do NOT work!</br>

# Compiling
You need to install [VitaSDK](https://vitasdk.org/) to your computer. I've edited and added files to make compiling process work using VitaSDK since the original plugin was meant to be compiled using DolceSDK, which is basically dead now. </br>
After installing VitaSDK, you can basically run "cmake" command to create the Makefile, then run the "make" command to compile the plugin. </br>
